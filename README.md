# AutomaticFoodDispenser

In this project, I wanted to make an automatic food dispenser for animals, allowing for different kinds of rewarding mechanisms. Think about a skinner box (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber) without all the punishment stuff. More concretely, I wanted the food dispenser to be able to:
- release food/treats based on an internal timer (e.g. release some food every hour)
- release food/treats based on an action of the animal (e.g. pushin a button)
- release food/treats based on other types of sensor data (e.g. distance, movement, sound, why not even specific animal detection based on computer vision..)

In addition, I wanted to make a food dispenser in wood, with a strong mechanical solution as well (in contrast to all these DIY food dispensers using plastic bottles and glue).
